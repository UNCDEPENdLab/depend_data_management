Data and Documentation Storage Plan
###################################

.. sectionauthor:: Selin Gok, Abbegail Lovette 

General breakdown of lab documentation storage:
===============================================

Slite will house all written documentation on lab activities while all lab data and materials will live on OneDrive. Both sites will have designated storage for work under construction, and the expectation will be that any ongoing work should be stored on its appropriate/relevant platform. Folder and file naming conventions on OneDrive will follow the naming conventions already determined for data storage on longleaf. Additionally, OneDrive primary folders will hold README files to their folder organization and contents.

General Example
===============
