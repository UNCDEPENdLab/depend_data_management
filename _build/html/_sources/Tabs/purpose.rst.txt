Goal
The overarching goal of this overall "data curation structure" is to provide a system that can be used across large-to-medium-scale human-subjects "studies" in order to facilitate data organization and begin a front-to-back process to recruit subjects, collect data, transfer and store backups of raw data, preprocess raw data and store preprocessed data, log and sort missing data, and perform quality assurance (QA) on incoming data with the generation of reports to be utilized in meetings to assess study flow and data quality.
Ultimately, this data curation structure should handle all aspects of running a large study from the administrative materials to study visit materials and protocols and data management and storage. Once data are "curated", the idea would be that a researcher wanting to analyze data would initialize a project-specific directory that would handle data analysis for that specific project. Thus, a study reflects a single ongoing data collection effort with the same participants. This can be large and multifaceted and will result in multiple publications, which is the level at which a user could use the study data for a project that will turn into a publishable manuscript.
