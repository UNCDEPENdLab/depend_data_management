Generating Data Reports
#######################

In this section, we will see how you can run a report or a series of reports to give you an up-to-date glimpse into different aspects of a study or project. We use reports in the lab across studies and projects to extract and present crucial information. Some examples are: a recruitment report detailing information about new contacts for a study (could include information about where they heard about the study, if they have filled out any screening information, etc.), a data missingness report (where a script automatically looks up in a master spreadsheet the subject ID numbers that we should expect to have data for and querying the storage location to ensure this data is not missing), or a data quality checking/QC report (which goes a step further and assesses if the existent data is usable for analysis). These are not exhaustive: if you want a quick readout on some aspect of your study or project in a semi-regular format, you can write some code to generate a report!
